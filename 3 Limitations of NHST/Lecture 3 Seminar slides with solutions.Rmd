# Question 1

- Let's start with some key terms. In groups, come up with definitions for the following: 
    - population
    - null and alternative hypotheses 
    - $\alpha$ 
    - $\beta$
    - power
    - Positive predictive value
    - False discovery rate
    - family-wise error rate
    - significance

# Answer 1
- population: the entire group that we want to draw conclusions about
    - examples: All the people in the UK
    - all university students in the UK
    - all patients with a diagnosis of depression
    - all female police officers in England
    - all first-grade children (including those who haven't been born yet)

# Answer 1
- null hypothesis: a conjecture about the population, usually stating that there is no difference between groups or no effect of another variable
    - if the null hypothesis is true, all observed differences have to be due to random variation
- alternative hypothesis: a conjecture about the population, usually stating that two groups are part of different populations or that there is a systematic effect of a certain variable on another

# Answer 1
- $\alpha$:
    - The probability of a test to reject the null hypothesis given that it is actually true (the probability of a Type I error)
- $\beta$:
    - The probability of a test **to fail to reject** the null hypothesis given that it is actually false (the probability of a Type II error)
- power:
    - The probability of a test **to reject** the null hypothesis given that it is actually false (the probability of not committing a Type II error)

# Answer 1
- Positive predictive value:
    - Subjective: The probability of the null hypothesis actually being false given that the null hypothesis was rejected
    - Objective: The proportion of correct rejections of the null hypothesis out of all rejections of the null hypothesis
    - Objective: The proportion of false rejections of the null hypothesis out of all rejections of the null hypothesis

- False discovery rate:
    - Subjective: The probability of the null hypothesis actually being true given that the null hypothesis was rejected
    - Objective: The proportion of false rejections of the null hypothesis out of all rejections of the null hypothesis

# Answer 1
- family-wise error rate:
    - The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis given that it is actually true in one or more of the tests forming a test family
    - Test family: a group of tests which, if significant, reject the same null hypothesis
- (statistical) significance:
    - The observed value of a null hypothesis test statistic being more extreme than the critical value of the test statistic, leading to the rejection of the null hypothesis.
    
# Question 2
- What is the difference between p-value and Î±?  

# Answer 2
- A p-value is the probability of obtaining results as extreme or more extreme than the observed results (observed p-value)
- $\alpha$ is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis given that the null hypothesis is true. Usually, you can achieve this in a test by comparing the p-value to $\alpha$ (critical p-value).
    - When doing multiple comparisons, you can adjust the critical p-value so that the overall $\alpha$ level stays the same

# Question 3
- Describe two legitimate stopping rules and two illegitimate ones.

# Answer 3
- Examples for legitimate stopping rules:
    - Stop at 40 participants (no matter what happens)
    - Stop after 90 days of data collection
    
- Examples of illegitimate stopping rules
    - Stop if a significant result is found after collecting data from 40 participants (otherwise, keep sampling)
    - Plan to collect data from 40 participants, but check after 30 participants if more are needed or if the result is significant

# Question 4 
- Some researchers (e.g. [Halsey et al., 2015, Nature Methods](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3288)) have argued that we should report confidence intervals rather than p-values in research articles. What would be the advantages and disadvantages of reporting them instead of p-values? 

- Advantages:
    - Confidence intervals give a clear indication of the uncertainty involved in a statistical test result
    - Confidence intervals emphasise the effect size -- an effect can be significant but irrelevant in reality

- Disadvantages
    - Confidence intervals still rely on null hypothesis significance testing and suffer from the same issues as any other NHST
    - The emphasis on the range may invite the incorrect subjective probability interpretation that they reflect uncertainty about the true value (i.e. misinterpreting them as Bayesian Credible Intervals)
