# Question 1

- Let's start with some key terms. In groups, come up with definitions for the following: 
    - population
    - null and alternative hypotheses 
    - $\alpha$ 
    - $\beta$
    - power
    - Positive predictive value
    - False discovery rate
    - family-wise error rate
    - significance

# Question 2
- What is the difference between p-value and Î±?  

# Question 3
- Describe two legitimate stopping rules and two illegitimate ones.  

# Question 4
- Some researchers (e.g. [Halsey et al., 2015, Nature Methods](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3288)) have argued that we should report confidence intervals rather than p-values in research articles. What would be the advantages and disadvantages of reporting them instead of p-values?
