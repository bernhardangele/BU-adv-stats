# Assignment

Here is another data set stolen from Andy Johnson. This one is about the relationship between alcohol and driving performance. Participants received either a drink with actual alcohol, a placebo drink that they thought contained alcohol, but actually didn't, or no drink at all.
Run the ANOVA and perform the appropriate assumption checks. Report the results as shown in the file `Homework3_template.Rmd`.
I've already started you off with opening the file below and adding a subject column -- you just have to make sure the working directory is correct.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# echo = FALSE 
# don't forget to replace the \ backslashes with forward slashes / if you're on Windows
library(ez)
library(knitr)

setwd("C:/replace_this_with_your_actual_working_directory/")

drive <- read.csv("Alcohol and driving performance.csv")

# add a subject column for ezANOVA
# very simple: each observation is a different person
# "subject" is a discrete variable, so make it a factor()
drive$subject <- factor(1:nrow(drive))
```
