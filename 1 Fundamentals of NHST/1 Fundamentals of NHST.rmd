## Why are we doing this?

Hello everyone and welcome to our first "real" lecture on Advanced Statistics. In our introductory session, I have already explained to you a bit about my idea of what "advanced" means in this context. In our undergraduate statistics units, we try to give students the absolute minimum in statistical education acceptable. This may surprise you, but given the resistance that many undergraduate students have to statistics (I'm not saying that this is the students' fault -- far too many of them -- and you --have internalised the misconception that you can't do maths), the lack of mathematical skills (compounded by the resistance to anything mathematical), and the limited time, this is the best we can do. We give you a small toolkit of step-by-step instructions to perform basic statistical tests without making catastrophic mistakes. If we are really good, we give you some degree of understanding of the basic ideas behind null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST). This is the kind of statistical education I have received myself and that you probably received as well (if you didn't receive any statistical education at all, don't worry: you were spared all the downsides of this type of training and can easily catch up on the practical step-by-step parts).
This kind of undergraduate education is a necessity -- we have to turn out students who can be trusted to do basic experiments and who can understand the statistical tests reported in research papers. However, I don't consider "advanced" statistics to be a continuation of teaching the "click here in SPSS" ritual for more complex tests that few people ever use (such as MANOVA). If you really understand what statistics is about and why we use them, understanding those complex tests (should you ever need them) will not be too difficult.
What I want to achieve in this unit is to get you to understand why we do statistics, and how to interpret statistical findings responsibly. This is much more important than knowing how to do a MANOVA in SPSS by heart.
Indeed, the current replication crisis in Psychology may be rooted in many cases in misunderstandings about statistics that even established psychologists have: misconceptions and confusions that were established in undergraduate education and that were never corrected even during years of postgraduate study and subsequent research work. These individuals certainly are highly skilled at scientific writing, at experiment design, and at using statistical software, but in some cases, they have "painted themselves into a corner" by consistently misinterpreting their results and by engaging in behaviour that (probably unwittingly) increased the probability of false positives. Now they have built a career on theories and findings that are possibly not replicable and for which maybe much less evidence exists than they thought. Note that this is not scientific fraud. I firmly believe that the individuals concerned performed their research to the best of their ability and conscience. However, if we want to move past this issue as a discipline, we have to improve our understanding of what we are doing when we are doing statistical tests. These first lectures will address this question, and in order to do that, we have to start with the Philosopht of Science. This part of the lecture will be following Zoltan Dienes' book "Understanding Psychology as a Science" fairly closely. I highly recommend that you buy it -- it is not very expensive at all.

To sum this introductory part up, as MSc students, you are studying for a science degree. Even if you are not looking to have a career in academia, your employers and colleagues will consider you to have scientific training and will look to you for making science-based decisions. In order to make these decisions responsibly, you MUST understand the ideas and assumptions underlying the methods that we are using in Psychology. To not teach you this would be a disservice to you and the field.


## Philosophy of Science

We will start with a fundamental question: What can we know? How can we be sure about something we think we know? We know that our senses and our minds can be tricked, as we have all made errors before. For example, just now I was sure that I had left my phone on the table, when actually it had fallen behind the sofa. If I can be wrong about something this trivial, how can I ever make conclusions about important things, such as how the brain works, or, if you are more practically minded, about whether a patient with anxiety will benefit from a new intervention, or whether a child would be better off being taken out of his or her family? If anything, those latter issues are even more critical than lofty pursuits such as understanding the human mind, as I can always correct a misconception I might have had about the visual system, but a child failed by the system may suffer damage for life.
Philosophers have been asking themselves these questions for a long time. As this is a class on statistics, and not philosophy, we will quickly cover the very basics of Popper, Kuhn, and Lakatos, and then jump right into the part about Neyman and Pearson and null-hypothesis significance testing (Chapter 3). I do recommend that you read the first two chapters that deal with Popper, Kuhn, and Lakatos in more detail as well, as their thinking underlies much of how we think about science.

# Karl Popper: Falsification and severe tests

Philosophers have been thinking about the question of what we can know for certain, for a very long time. There are some philosophers, like Hume, who thought that really nothing we think we know is certain. Everything could be an illusion. Most philosophers don't go this far. In the early 20th century, the "Vienna Circle" of logical positivists (e.g. Kurt GÃ¶del, Rudolf Carnap, and Carl Hempel) proposed a distinction between statements that are definitions (like "a triangle has three sides"), which are necessarily true, statements that are verifiable through observation of the world ("my desk is three foot tall"), and statements that are unverifiable ("The world is an illusion"). The logical positivists thought that unverifiable statements were essentially meaningless metaphysics, and we should focus on definitions and verifiable statements (i.e. logic, mathematics, and science). 
How do you verify a statement based on empirical observations? For "my desk is three foot tall", that is easy, you just get a ruler and measure it, but what about generalisations like "all swans are white"? For this, the logical positivists proposed a process called induction: inferring universal rules given particular observations:

>Swan 1 is white

>Swan 2 is white

>...

>Swan 999 is white

>Conclusion: All swans are white?

The problem is that this conclusion isn't necessarily true: There is always the possibility that the next swan you see is black even if the last 999 were white (apparently, this actually happened when the British went to Australia!). Karl Popper was an Austrian philosopher who thought a great deal about this problem. His conclusion was: You cannot actually use inference to prove a theory about the world to be true. However, a single counterexample is enough to prove a theory false! A single black swan causes us to reject the hypothesis that all swans are white. Science is critical discussion: Everyone is always making up new theories and then trying to disprove both their own and others' theories. Theories that cannot be falsified are non-science or metaphysics. Theories that survive criticism (for a while, at least) are not "proven", they are "corroborated".

# Falsifiable and non-falsifiable theories

What is a falsifiable theory? Consider psychoanalysis: A psychoanalyst proposes that a patient's fear of flying is caused by an Oedipus complex (i.e. sexual attraction to his mother in his infancy). If the patient confirms this, the psychoanalyst will take this as evidence for his theory. If the patient strongly denies this (which is probably more likely), the psychoanalyst will conclude that the Oedipus complex must be repressed by the patient. The patient's denial is then also evidence for the psychoanalyst's theory. Essentially, psychoanalytic theories are not falsifiable, therefore Popper would say that they are not a scientific.

As Psychologists and scientists, we must ensure that our theories actually yield testable, that is, falsifiable hypotheses. 

Dienes (2008) gives a good example (Box 1.5, p. 9):

> Consider the following two factor theory of liking:
> Factor 1: We are preogrammed to like familiar things (e.g. foods, people, animals, tools, etc.) because our knowledge and skills are likely to apply to them. They are not dagerous, we can deal with them. This, there is a mechanism that automatically makes us like things as we come across them more often.
>Factor 2: But we also get bored with familiar things, because there is little to learn from them and we have a drive to learn.
>These two factors act in opposition to each other.
So increasing people's exposure to a new thing can

>1. Increase people's liking because the familiarity means it is safe (first factor operating)
>2. Decrease people's liking because they get bored (second factor operating)
>3. First increase then decrease liking because the first factor operates initially before boredom becomes stronger.
>4. First decrease then increase liking becasue boredom operates initially before the first factor becomes stronger.

> The theory is a good one because it explains all these outcomes.
> Discuss.

Think about this example now. We will discuss it later in class.


## Degrees of falsifiability

Are there some theories that are easier to falsify than others? Essentially, the more observations can potentially contradict the theory, the more falsifiable is. For example, for many psychoanalytic theories, there is essentially no observation that could possibly contradict it. But also think of Psychology: Often, the most basic hypothesis is a very simple one of difference: 

>Participants in Condition A will perform differently from those in Condition B. 

There are not very many ways to falsify this hypothesis since the conditions can differ in many possible ways. A hypothesis like 

> Participants Condition A will perform better than those in Condition B 

is better, since it can be falsified by 50% of the possible outcomes. A hypothesis like

> The performance in Condition A will be 30% better than that in Condition B

is even better, since it can be falsified by a lot of possible outcomes. Similar considerations apply to hypotheses about correlation:

> There is a correlation between Factor A and Factor B

can only be falsified by a very specific outcome, while

> There is a positive correlation between Factor A and Factor B

can be falsified by 50% of possible outcomes.

This issue is directly related to the "multiverse" or "garden of forking paths" issue described by Andrew Gelman in the talk I have asked you to watch. Do your choices in analysing the data make it harder to falsify your hypothesis? 

Popper's work is of course applicable to Psychology. However, we face (along with some other sciences) a particular problmens in terms of how distinguish between observations that reflect a real property of the world and observations that are merely the result of random, unrelated noise.In some fileds like physics, the noise can often be reduced considerably until the signal (the effect we want to observe) becomes quite clear. In contrast, in Psychology, we measure either human behaviour or the correlates of human behaviour. Since humans are extremely complex systems, our effects are at all times influenced by a lot of processes acting at the same time. We usually have no way to our effects tend to be in relull hypothesis significance testing (NHST). We will work out the logic of null-hypothesis significance testing using the simple dice problem you did in our last lecture.


The dice problem
==========================================================
- IN THEORY, each of our dice roll outcomes has the same probability:
$$ 
\begin{aligned}
p(1) = \frac{n_1}{n_{total}} &= \frac{1}{6},
p(2) = \frac{n_2}{n_{total}} &= \frac{1}{6}\\
p(3) = \frac{n_3}{n_{total}} &= \frac{1}{6},
p(4) = \frac{n_4}{n_{total}} &= \frac{1}{6}\\ 
p(5) = \frac{n_5}{n_{total}} &= \frac{1}{6},
p(6) = \frac{n_6}{n_{total}} &= \frac{1}{6}
\end{aligned}
$$
- But how can we test whether that is actually true?
- We need some way to compare the data to the theoretical probability distribution

Aggregating our dice results
==========================================================
- We obviously need to take more than one dice roll into account. But how can we aggregate all our results in a convenient number?
- As luck would have it, descriptive statistics provides us with a number of standard measures to characterise the properties of a *sample* (e.g. rolling the dice 10 times):
- Measures of *central tendency*:
  - The mean: $\bar{x}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n}$
  - The median: The number separating the higher half of a sample from the lower half
  - The mode: The most frequent observation
- Measures of dispersion:
  - The variance: $s_x^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2$

Statistics basics: Random variables
==========================================================
- We need to consider our sample as a random variable
- What is a random variable?
  - A random variable is a function that assigns a number to each possible outcome of our experiment (the dice roll)
- The outcome of a single dice roll can be described by a very obvious function: just assign the numbers from 1 to 6
- The outcome of *multiple* dice rolls is  little trickier
- Regardless of which one we choose, we can then come up with a *theoretical* probability distribution for the random variable.
- The opposite of a random variable is a *constant*, a value that's the same for every sample.

Statistics basics: Random variables (formal definition!)
==========================================================
- Warning: Some mathematical notation follows.
- A random variable $X$ is a function $X : O \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ that associates to each outcome
$\omega \in O$ exactly one number $X(\omega) = x$.
  - Note: $\mathbb{R}$ = real numbers
- $O_X$ is all the $x$'s (all the possible values of X, the support of X). i.e., $x \in O_X$.
- Good example: number of coin tosses till you get Heads (H) for the first time

  - $X: \omega \rightarrow x$
	- $\omega$: H, TH, TTH,$\dots$ (infinite)
	- $x=0,1,2,\dots; x \in O_X$
  
Random variables (2)
==========================================================
Every discrete random variable X has associated with it a  **probability mass function**, also called *distribution function*.
$$
p_X : S_X \rightarrow [0, 1] 
$$
defined by
$$
p_X(x) = P(X(\omega) = x), x \in S_X
$$
- Back to the example: number of coin tosses till H

  - $X: \omega \rightarrow x$
  - $\omega$: H, TH, TTH,$\dots$ (infinite)
	- $x=0,1,2,\dots; x \in S_X$
  - $p_X = .5, .25, .125,\dots$ 
  

What is a probability distribution?
========================================================
From Wikipedia:
In probability and statistics, a probability distribution assigns a probability to each measurable subset of the possible outcomes of a random experiment, survey, or procedure of statistical inference.
Here's an example of a discrete probability distribution, the distribution of the *sum of two dice rolls*:

![Dice Distribution (from Wikipedia)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Dice_Distribution_%28bar%29.svg/512px-Dice_Distribution_%28bar%29.svg.png)

Discrete probability distribution
========================================================
![Dice Distribution (from Wikipedia)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Dice_Distribution_%28bar%29.svg/512px-Dice_Distribution_%28bar%29.svg.png)

Every possible outcome (sum of the numbers rolled on two dice) is assigned a corresponding probability. This is called a *probability mass function*.

Important: all values sum to 1.

A quick clarification: Sample and population
==========================================================
- With the introduction of *theoretical* probability distributions, we need to be very careful to not confuse properties of the theoretical distribution with properties of an individual sample.
- Standard practice is to use 
    - roman letters (e.g. $m$ or $\bar{x}$ for the mean, $s$ for the standard deviation) for properties of the sample
    - greek letters (e.g. $\mu$ "mu" for the mean and $\sigma$ "sigma" for the standard deviation) for properties of the distribution (or the population that is represented by the distribution).

From discrete to continuous
=======================================================
- Let's look at the probability distributions we get from rolling one, two, three etc. dice and summing up the results.
- We'll start with rolling one die (note that the bars may be a tiny bit uneven since I used a simulation to produce this graph).

```{r, echo=F}
plot_freq_hist <- function(vec, breaks = "Sturges", title){
  h <- hist(vec, plot=FALSE, breaks=breaks, right = FALSE)
  h$counts=h$counts/sum(h$counts)
  plot(h, main = title, xlab = "X", ylab = "P(X)")
}

plot_discrete_hist <- function(vec, title){
  counts <- table(vec)
  barplot(counts/sum(counts), main = title, xlab = "X", ylab = "P(X)")
}

plot_discrete_hist(sample(1:6, 1000000, replace = TRUE), title = "One die")

```

Two dice
=======================================================
- This is the same as the image from Wikipedia.

```{r, echo=F}

plot_discrete_hist(sample(1:6, 100000, replace = TRUE)+sample(1:6,100000, replace = TRUE), title = "Two dice")

```

Three dice
=======================================================
```{r, echo=F}

plot_discrete_hist(sample(1:6, 100000, replace = TRUE)+sample(1:6,100000, replace = TRUE)+sample(1:6, 100000, replace = TRUE), title = "Three dice")

```

Four dice
=======================================================
```{r, echo=F}

plot_discrete_hist(sample(1:6, 100000, replace = TRUE)+sample(1:6,100000, replace = TRUE)+sample(1:6, 100000, replace = TRUE)+sample(1:6, 100000, replace = TRUE),title = "Four dice")

```

Ten dice
=======================================================
```{r, echo=F}

roll_dice <- function(number_of_samples, number_of_dice){
  result <- sample(1:6, number_of_samples, replace = TRUE)
  for(i in 1:(number_of_dice-1)){
    result<-result + sample(1:6, number_of_samples, replace = TRUE)
  }
  result
}

plot_discrete_hist(roll_dice(100000, 10),title = "Ten dice")

```

100 dice
=======================================================
```{r, echo=F}

plot_freq_hist(roll_dice(100000, 100), 150, title = "100 dice")

```

Do you see a pattern?
========================================================
- Central limit theorem (CLT)

> When sampling from a population that has a mean, provided the sample size is large
> enough, the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be close to normal regardless
> of the shape of the population distribution

- (Technically, we were sampling the sum of X rather than the mean, but the mean of X is simply the sum divided by the number of observations. Do you care about this distintion? Didn't think so. It makes me feel better, though.)

What does this mean?
========================================================
- For our dice problem, it means that we can compute the means of our samples (e.g. the mean of the 5, or 10, or 100 samples) 
- Remember, the *sample mean* is a random variable as well, since it is different every time we take a sample
- We can then use a *continuous* probability distribution -- the **normal distribution** as the theoretical probability distribution for our random variable (i.e. the sample mean).
- This makes our life easy, because the normal distribution is very simple to handle mathematically (really!).


Continuous probability distributions
=======================================================
```{r, echo=F}
plot(function(x) dnorm(x), -3, 3,
main = "Normal density",ylim=c(0,.4),
ylab="density",xlab="X")
```

Here, the outcomes are continuous, so it doesn't make sense to ask about the probability of any point on the x-axis.
- What is the probability of x = 1? 
 - What do you mean by "1"? The function is continuous, so does 1.00001 still qualify as 1?
- It makes more sense to ask these questions about intervals. The probability is then the area under the curve for the interval.
- Important: the total area under the curve is 1.

Normal probability density function (PDF)
========================================================
$$
  f(x,\mu,\sigma) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{-((x - \mu)^2/2 \sigma^2)}
$$

```{r, echo=F}
plot(function(x) dnorm(x), -3, 3,
main = "Normal density",ylim=c(0,.4),
ylab="density",xlab="X")
```

Normal probability density function (PDF)
========================================================
$$
  f(x,\mu,\sigma) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{-((x - \mu)^2/2 \sigma^2)}
$$
- This looks scary, but it really isn't. This is simply a mathematical function that happens to describe the distribution of a lot of random variables in nature.
    - If you look closely, you can see that the function has three parameters, $x, \mu,$ and $\sigma$ ($\pi$ and $e$ are constants).
      - The first parameter, $x$ is the random variable. The function gives you the probability density at each value of $x$
      - The second parameter, $\mu$, is called the **expected value** or the **mean** of the distribution.
      - The third parameter, $\sigma$, is called the standard deviation.

Standard normal distribution
=======================================================
- There is an infinite number of normal distributions with different parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma$. The one with $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = 1$ is particularly useful and is called the *standard* normal distribution.
- Look at how simple and nice the normal distribution appears when we plug in those values:
$$
  f(z,\mu,\sigma) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{-z^2/2}
$$
- You can *transform* values from any normal distribution to the normal distribution.
- This is known as a *z-transformation*: $z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$
- By transforming all our observations to z-values and then looking up their probability in the standard normal distribution, this is the only distribution we'll ever need (...mostly).

The probability of outcomes in the standard normal distribution
=======================================================
- Remember, we can't really get the probability of a *point* event in a continuous distribution, since there are no "points" in a continuous variable
- But we can ask questions about *intervals*:
- What's the probability of x being between 0 and 1?

```{r, echo = F}
cord.x <- c(0,seq(0,1,0.01),1)
cord.y <- c(0,dnorm(seq(0,1,0.01)),0)
curve(dnorm(x,0,1),xlim=c(-3,3),main='Standard Normal')
polygon(cord.x,cord.y,col='skyblue')
```

Getting the area under the curve
=======================================================
- Since we know exactly what the function is, we can get the area under the curve.
  - Remember how to do that from maths class? Your best friend, integration :
$$ p (0 < z < 1) = \int\limits_{0}^{1} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{-z^2/2} dz$$
- Don't want to do integration? Well, you're in luck, because most statistical software (and Excel!) can do this for you.
- `=NORM.S.DIST(0,TRUE)` will give you the area under the curve to the left of 0 (i.e. the probability that $z < 0$)
- `=NORM.S.DIST(1,TRUE)` will give you the area under the curve to the left of 1 (i.e. the probability that $z < 1$)

Getting the area under the curve
=======================================================
- Remember, Excel gives us the *lower* tail (the area under the curve to the *left* of the $z$ value)
  - So we can calculate our interval: $p (0 < z < 1) = p(z < 1) - p(z < 0)$
  - In Excel: 
      - `=NORM.S.DIST(1,TRUE)-NORM.S.DIST(0, TRUE)`
      - Result: `r pnorm(1)-pnorm(0)`
- Success!

Things you can do with this knowledge
========================================================
- Say I'm looking at random numbers from a standard normal distribution, and I see that one of them is 4.
  - That seems very unusual
  - Just how unusual?
    - What's the probability of getting a value of 4 when sampling from a standard normal distribution (mean = 0, sd = 1)?  

Just how unusual is a value of 4?
========================================================
- Remember, when you have a continuous distribution, you can't think about point values (e.g. 5). Rather, what you want to know is:
    - What is the probability of getting a value of 4 *or greater* (or $p(z > 4) = 1-p(z < 4)$)?
- Let's ask Excel: `=1-NORM.S.DIST(4,TRUE)`
    - Result: `r format(dnorm(4), scipen = 8)`
- So it's very unusual.
- Can we come up with a similar test for our dice sample mean?
- We'll have to figure out how the dice sample means are distributed.
    - Then we can take our sample mean and see how likely (or unlikely) it is that it comes from the theoretical distribution.

The theoretical distribution of dice sample means
========================================================
- We've seen that we can approximate our theoretical distribution (which is actually discrete) using a continuous distribution function, namely the normal distribution, which makes our lives very easy (yes, really!).
- We have to figure out the $\mu$ and the $sigma$ parameters for our theoretical normal distribution of sample means, though.
- Note for those of you who care (probably no one): In the case that we actually know exactly what the probabilities for our discrete probability distribution should look like, we could also use a different distribution, the $\chi^2$ (chi square) distibution. More about that next week, otherwise our heads may explode.

Random variables: Expected value
========================================================
- Random variables have expected values
- For discrete random variables, the expected value is the outcome value multiplied by the probability of the outcome:
$$ E(X) = \mu = \sum\limits_{i=1}^k p(x_i)\cdot x_i$$
  - where $E(X)$ is the expected value of a discrete random variable $X$ with the outcomes $(x_1 \dots x_k)$ and the associated probabilities $(p(x_1)\dots p(x_k))$
- The equivalent for continuous random variables:
$$\mu = \int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty}x f(x) dx$$

Random variables: Variance
========================================================
- Random variables also have variances
- For discrete random variables, the variance is the difference between the outcome value and the mean multiplied by the probability of the outcome:
$$ \sigma^2 = \sum\limits_{i=1}^k p(x_i)\cdot (x_i - \mu)^2$$
  - where $\sigma^2$ is the variance of a discrete random variable $X$ with the outcomes $(x_1 \dots x_k)$ and the associated probabilities $(p(x_1)\dots p(x_k))$
- The equivalent for continuous random variables:
$$\mu = \int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty}(x-\mu)^2 f(x) dx$$


Maths basics: Expected values
========================================================
- For example, the expected value $\mu$ of rolling a six-sided die is:
$$
\begin{aligned}
E(X) &= \sum\limits_{i=1}^{6} p(x_i) \cdot x_i \\
    &= x_1 \cdot p(x_1) + x_2 \cdot p(x_2) + x_3 \cdot p(x_3) + x_4 \cdot p(x_4) \\ 
    &+ x_5 \cdot p(x_5) + x_6 \cdot p(x_6) \\
    &= 1 \cdot \frac{1}{6} + 2 \cdot \frac{1}{6} + 3 \cdot \frac{1}{6} + 4 \cdot \frac{1}{6} \\ 
    &+ 5 \cdot \frac{1}{6} + 6 \cdot \frac{1}{6} \\
    &= \frac{21}{6} = 3.5
\end{aligned}
$$

Maths basics: Variance
========================================================
- For example, the variance $\sigma^2$ of rolling a six-sided die is:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\sigma^2 &= \sum\limits_{i=1}^6 p(x_i)\cdot (x_i - \mu)^2 \\
    &= (x_1-\mu)^2 \cdot p(x_1) + (x_2-\mu)^2 \cdot p(x_2) + (x_3-\mu)^2 \cdot p(x_3) \\
    &+ (x_4-\mu)^2 \cdot p(x_4) + (x_5-\mu)^2 \cdot p(x_5) + (x_6-\mu)^2 \cdot p(x_6) \\
    &= \frac{1}{6}\cdot \Big((1-3.5)^2 + (2-3.5)^2 + (3-3.5)^2 \\
    &+ (4-3.5)^2 + (5-3.5)^2+ (6-3.5)^2\Big) \\
    &= \frac{17.5}{6} = 2.9167
\end{aligned}
$$

Back to the dice example again
=======================================================
- So, we know that, if our dice are fair, our dice rolls come from a discrete theoretical distribution with $\mu = 3.5$ and $\sigma^2 = 2.9167$. 
- But remember, we don't want to evaluate single dice rolls, but rather the mean of a sample of dice rolls, since that will enable us to use the nice and easy normal distribution to calculate the probabilities.
- So, what is the mean $\mu_{\bar{x}}$ and what is the variance $\sigma_{\bar{x}^2}$ for the **distribution of sample means**?


Maths basics: Expected values (3)
========================================================
- What is the expected value of rolling two dice and adding the spots?
- What is the expected value of rolling two dice and multiplying the number of spots?
- What is the expected value of an IQ test result?
- Imagine you and your friend both take IQ tests. What is the expected value of the differences between your scores (assuming that you both come from the general population)?
    - Don't know? Well, stay tuned. This will require some maths, though.


Maths basics: Computing expected values
========================================================
- The expected value of a random variable is often also called $\mu$:
$$E(X) = \mu$$
  - $\mu$ is also called the distribution *mean*
- What if the expected value is constant across all the possible outcomes?
  - e.g what is the expected value of a die with 1 on all sides? 
      - 1, of course!
- More general:
  - if the value is the same across all outcomes, we can call it a constant
  - e.g. if $x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = \dots = x_i = 1$
      - then $E(X) = E(1) = 1$

Maths basics: Computing expected values (2)
=======================================================
Even more general: If a is a constant, then $E(a) = a$
- If $X$ is a random variable and $a$ is a constant, what is the expected value of $a \cdot X$?
$$E(a\cdot X) = a \cdot E(X)$$
- For example, if the expected value of rolling a 6-sided die is 3.5, what is the expected value of rolling a 6-sided die and then multiplying the number of spots by 3?
$$ E(3\cdot X) = 3\cdot E(X) = 3\cdot 3.5 = 10.5$$
- Try it if you don't believe me!

Maths basics: Computing expected values (3)
=======================================================
- If $X$ is a random variable and $a$ is a constant, what is the expected value of $a + X$?
$$E(a + X) = a + E(X)$$
- For example, if the expected value of rolling a 6-sided die is 3.5, what is the expected value of rolling a 6-sided die and then adding 3 to the number of spots?
$$ E(3 + X) = 3 + E(X) = 3 + 3.5 = 6.5$$
- Try it if you still don't believe me!

Maths basics: Computing expected values (4)
=======================================================
- If $X$ is a random variable and $Y$ is a random variable, what is the expected value of $X + Y$?
$$E(X + Y) = E(X) + E(Y)$$
- For example, if the expected value of rolling two 6-sided dice and adding the two results?
$$ E(X + Y) = E(X) + E(Y)= 3.5 + 3.5 = 7$$
- Try it if you still don't believe me!

Maths basics: Computing expected values (5)
=======================================================
- If $X$ is a random variable and $Y$ is a random variable, what is the expected value of $X \cdot Y$?
$$E(X \cdot Y) = E(X) \cdot E(Y)$$
- But *ONLY* if $X$ and $Y$ are *INDEPENDENT*
- For example, if the expected value of rolling two 6-sided dice and multiplying the two results?
$$ E(X + Y) = E(X) \cdot E(Y)= 3.5 \cdot 3.5 = 12.25$$
- Try it if you still don't believe me!

The expected value of the sample mean
========================================================
- If $X$ is a random variable, and we take a sample of size $n$ from $X$, what is the expected value of the mean of that sample?
- Remember, this is how you compute the sample mean: 
$$\bar{x} = \frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}}{n}$$
- The expected value of the sample mean is:
$$
\begin{aligned}
E(\bar{X}) &= E\Bigg(\frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}}{n}\Bigg)\\
           &= \frac{1}{n}\cdot\big(E\sum\limits_{i=1}^n{X_i}\big)
\end{aligned}$$

The expected value of the sample mean (2)
========================================================
$$
\begin{aligned}
           &= \frac{1}{n}\cdot\big(E\sum\limits_{i=1}^n{X_i}\big) \text{ (since } E(a\cdot X) = a \cdot E(X)\text{)} \\
           &= \frac{1}{n}\cdot\sum\limits_{i=1}^n{E(X_i)} \text{ (since } E(X+Y) = E(X) + E(Y)\text{)} \\
           &= \frac{1}{n}\cdot\sum\limits_{i=1}^n{\mu_x} \text{ (since } E(X) = \mu \text{)} \\
           &= \frac{1}{n}\cdot n \cdot\mu_x = \mu_x
\end{aligned}$$


The expected value of the sample mean (3)
========================================================
- We just found that the expected value of the sample mean $E(\bar{X})$ is identical to the expected value (the mean) of the population $\mu_x$, *regardless of the sample size*.
- We can say that the sample mean $\overline{X}$ is an *unbiased estimator* of the population mean $\mu$
- No matter what we do and what crazy population we're taking samples of, the sample means will always be distributed around the true population mean.
    - *Isn't that cool?*
    - I know what you're thinking right now, but this is *actually* cool. Just think about it: If you want to know the true population mean of any population, all you have to do is take enough samples.
    
Our dice example
========================================================
- Remember, we want to know how the means of our dice rolls should be distributed if the dice are fair. So, now we know that they are normally distributed (because of the Central Limit Theorem) with an expected value of $\mu_{\bar{x}} = 3.5$.
- What about the *variance* of the *distribution of sample means*?
    - Well, this will take some work. Sorry, people. It's maths time.
    - First, we need to know how the sample variance is related to the population variance.
    - In other words, we need to know the expected value of the sample variance.

The expected value of the sample variance
========================================================
- We could now go through the same process for the sample variance $s^2$, but this would take a lot of time and most of you may not care about the details.
- Instead, I will just tell you what we would find if we did this:
- It turns out that the sample variance $$s^2 = \frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \mu)^2}{n}$$ is **not** an unbiased estimator of the population variance. In fact, it *underestimates* the population variance.
- I have posted a link to [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1hgiAla3KI) that very nicely and intuitively demonstrates this point on myBU in case you don't believe me.

The expected value of the sample variance (2)
========================================================
- We can correct our sample variance if we divide by $n-1$ instead of $n$:
$$s^2 = \frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \mu)^2}{n-1}$$
- This definition of the sample variance *does* give us an unbiased estimator of the population variance $\sigma^2$.
- I have posted a link to [another video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ONRMymR2Eg) that gives you the proof of this in case you don't believe me. 

The expected value of the variance of sample means
========================================================
- Remember, now we are no longer talking about the population variance $\sigma^2$ now, but the **variance of the sample means** $\sigma_{\bar{x}}^2$. 
- Also remember that the population does not have to be distributed normally, but the means of samples from this distribution will be if the sample size is large enough (that's the whole reason we're concerning ourselves with the means rather than individual samples here).
- We'll start by rewriting $E(\sigma_{\bar{x}}^2)$ as $Var(\bar{X})$, that is, the expected variance of the sample mean. Same thing, but makes the following steps more obvious.

The expected value of the variance of sample means (2)
========================================================
- Now we replace $\bar{X}$ with the definition of the sample mean:
$$
\begin{aligned}
Var(\bar{X}) &= Var(\frac{X_1 + X_2 + \dots + X_n}{n})\\
&= \frac{1}{n^2}\cdot Var(X_1 + X_2 + \dots + X_n)
\end{aligned}
$$
- What have we done now? We just moved the constant out of the expected variance
    - Tiny not-that-intuitive detail: The variance is a square ($s^2$), so as we move $1/n$ out of the term, we need to square it too.
    
The expected value of the variance of sample means (3)
========================================================
- We can treat expected variances just like expected values. 
    - If (and only if!) $X_1, X_2,\dots, X_n$ are independent (i.e. the value of $X_1$ doesn't depend on the value of $X_2$, or $X_3$, etc.), we can rewrite the expected variance of a sum as the sum of its expected variances 
$$
\begin{aligned}
Var(\bar{X}) &= \frac{1}{n^2}\cdot Var(X_1 + X_2 + \dots + X_n)\\
             &=\frac{1}{n^2}\cdot (Var(X_1) + Var(X_2) + \dots + Var(X_n))
\end{aligned}
$$  

The expected value of the variance of sample means (4)
========================================================
- We just established that the expected value of the variance of each individual sample (if we apply the correction and divide by $n-1$) is the population variance $\sigma^2$. So let's replace each term $Var(X_i)$ with $\sigma^2$:
$$
\begin{aligned}
Var(\bar{X}) &= \frac{1}{n^2}\cdot(Var(X_1) + Var(X_2) + \dots + Var(X_n)) \\
             &= \frac{1}{n^2}\cdot(\sigma^2 + \sigma^2 + \dots + \sigma^2) \\
             &= \frac{1}{n^2}\cdot n \cdot \sigma^2 \\
             &= \frac{\sigma^2}{n}
\end{aligned}
$$
- So, the expected value of the variance of sample means $\sigma_{\bar{x}}^2$ is $\frac{\sigma^2}{n}$ and the expected value of the standard deviation of sample means (also called **standard error**) is $\sigma_{\bar{x}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$.


Please, let's FINALLY finish the dice example
================================================================
- OK, OK. We now have everything we need to determine whether our dice roll sample mean is unusual assuming fair dice.
- More formally, we call this a **Hypothesis Test**
- We establish a *Null Hypothesis* $H_0$ (e.g. the dice are fair), 
    - determine a theoretical probability distribution of the random variable (our dice roll means) given that the $H_0$ is true:
        - a normal distribution with $\mu_{\bar{x}} = 3.5$ and $\sigma_{\bar{x}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{\sqrt{2.9167}}{\sqrt{n}}$, where n is the number of dice rolls in our sample,
    - and finally we can calculate the probability that you would observe the sample mean you observed given the $H_0$.
    
Final steps
=================================================================
- So, let's assume you did 10 dice rolls for this example, and that your mean was 4.
- Since we know that the sample means should be normally distributed, we can transform your mean into a *z*-value: 
- Since $\mu_{\bar{x}} = 3.5$ and $\sigma_{\bar{x}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{\sqrt{2.9167}}{\sqrt{10}} = `r sqrt(2.9167)/sqrt(10)`$:
$$ z(4) = \frac{4-3.5}{`r sqrt(2.9167)/sqrt(10)`}=`r (4-3.5)/(sqrt(2.9167)/sqrt(10))`$$
- Let's ask Excel what the probability of observing a sample mean this far away (or farther) from the population mean is for the standard normal distribution: `1-NORM.S.DIST(0.9258,TRUE)`
    - Result: 0.177274964
    
Final steps (2)
=================================================================
- Fisher (who popularised this sort of hypothesis testing) suggested that we should consider data with a probability of less than 5% (or .05) given the null hypothesis as **significant** evidence for rejecting the null hypothesis.
- In our case, we are far away from a probability (or short, *p*-value) of .05. So, we can't reject the null hypothesis. Try it for yourselves, though.
- More on this next week.

Technical note for those who really care
=================================================================
- We really don't care about the direction of the effect here, just the absolute distance from the mean (i.e. this is a *two-tailed* test).
- So, to be absolutely correct, we should ask Excel to give us the probability of z being at least this far away from the mean on either side: $p(z < -.9258 \cup z > .9258) = p(z < -.9258) + (1-p(z < .9258))$. 
- When we ask Excel for the p-value `=NORM.S.DIST(-0.9258,TRUE)+(1-NORM.S.DIST(0.9258,TRUE))` we get the actual, correct result of $`r pnorm(-.9258)+(1-pnorm(.9258))`$.
- Good times. Until next week!
