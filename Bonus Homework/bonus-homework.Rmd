Notes
=====

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this (don't worry about these specific commands for now):

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

We'll be using R Markdown for all your homework assignments. Take a look at https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics for more information. RStudio will generate great looking HTML files from your RMarkdown files, which you can submit on 

Here are some neat things you can do with Markdown:

- Make bullet points
  - Make sub points
- Make words **bold** or *italic*.
- Add inline code
  - "The `plot` command is fantastic"
- Add links
  - e.g. the aforementioned [Github Markdown Basics](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics)
- Add images:

# Headings
## Subheadings
### Sub-subheadings

RMarkdown adds the ability to add R code either inline (e.g., the value of pi is `r pi` and 3 times 4 is `r 3*4`) or in code blocks (see above). When you click the **Knit HTML** button, the R code will be replaced with its output.

Assignment
==========

Your homework assignments will usually have some code already in place. You will just have to make the required changes, fill in your name and date, and upload the updated Rmd file (that is, **this** file) to myBU.

For today's first assignment, change the code block below so that the histogram will be of a normal distribution with mean=100 and sd=15 (instead of mean=0 and sd=1 ). That's all! Hint: The necessary changes can be done in as little as 3 keystrokes (and maybe 2 mouse clicks to move around). Feel free to play around with Markdown and R Markdown as much as you like beyond that.

```{r, echo=T}
number_of_samples <- 1000
my_random_data <- rnorm(n = number_of_samples, mean = 0, sd = 1)
hist(my_random_data)
```
